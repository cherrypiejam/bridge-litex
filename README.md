# Tock on LiteX

This is a companion repository to running [Tock](https://github.com/tock/tock)
on [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) SoCs.

For more information on Tock, please visit the [website](https://tockos.org) and
[main repository](https://github.com/tock/tock).

## Contents

This repository contains build scripts for generating FPGA bitstreams, matching
the hardware expectations of the LiteX SoCs in the main Tock repository.

The [boards](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/litex) in Tock
target specific versions of the varios LiteX cores & components, along with
certain configuration options. This repository pins tested versions of
repositories from the LiteX ecosystem. Generated artifacts and bitstreams are
uploaded & released on GitHub.

This repository aims to always track the Tock master branch and publish
compatible bitstreams.

Currently included boards are:
- Digilent Arty A7-35T: [digilent_arty.nix](./digilent_arty.nix)

## Prebuilt artifacts and bitstreams

The [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/lschuermann/tock-litex/releases)
contains prebuilt artifacts and releases (as [built
here](#Building-a-release)). These can be used to avoid downloading large FPGA
toolchains to build bitstreams or Scala for custom VexRiscv CPU variants.

## LiteX Simulation (Verilator)

To run the LiteX simulation, along with the corresponding [Tock board
definition](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/litex), a
`nix-shell` with all required dependencies can be entered:

```
$ nix-shell shell.nix
```

From within this enviroment all LiteX tools along with `litex_sim` are
available:

```
[nix-shell:~/tock-litex]$ litex_sim \
  --csr-data-width=32 \
  --integrated-rom-size=1048576 \
  --cpu-variant=secure \
  --with-ethernet \
  --rom-init $PATH_TO_TOCK_BINARY
[...]
make: Leaving directory '/home/leons/develop/tock/boards/litex/sim/build/sim/gateware'

[sudo] password for user:
[spdeeprom] loaded (addr = 0x0)
[...]
[clocker] sys_clk: freq_hz=1000000, phase_deg=0
Verilated LiteX+VexRiscv: initialization complete, entering main loop.
```

If desired, Xilinx Vivado can be made available in the shell by adding the
appropriate argument:

```
$ nix-shell --arg enableVivado true shell.nix
```

## Build instructions

While building boards currently depends on the Nix package manager through the
contained Nix derivations, efforts are made to allow building without the Nix
package manager installed in the future.

### Build a single board

To build a single board, run

```
$ nix-build $BOARD.nix
```

Note that this will use the default nixpkgs as defined in the environment for
downloading dependencies. It might take a while to build all dependencies.

By default, this will generate all LiteX artificats, including the FPGA
bitstreams. To generate bitstreams for Xilinx FPGAs the proprietary Vivado
software suite is required, hence by default only the Verilog sources will be
generated for these respective boards. To attempt to build a bitstream using
Vivado, run the build using

```
$ nix-build $BOARD.nix --arg buildBitstream true
```

This will attempt to build a [Xilinx Vivado 2020.01 WebPack
derivation](./pkgs/vivado/default.nix) first. To use a custom Vivado derivation,
pass it in using the `vivado` argument. Due to Sandboxing this path must point
to the Nix store.

### Building a release

To generate ZIPs for upload to GitHub, run

```
$ nix-build release.nix
```

The created target directory will contain the respective build artifacts as
`.zip` / `.tar.gz` archives.
